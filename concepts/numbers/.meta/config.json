  "blurb": "There are three different types of built-in numbers: integers (\"int\"), floating-point (\"float\"), and complex (\"complex\"). Ints have arbitrary precision and floats typically have 15 decimal places of precision -- but both Int and float precision vary by host system. Complex numbers have a real and an imaginary part - each represented by floats.",
