# About

[Python][python docs] is a [dynamic and strongly][dynamic typing in python] typed [object-oriented][object oriented programming] programming language.
It employs both [duck typing][duck typing] and [gradual typing][gradual typing] (via [type hints][type hints]).
It supports multiple programming paradigms including imperative (_object-oriented, procedural_) and declarative (_functional, concurrent_) flavors.
But do not be fooled: while programming across paradigms is fully supported, [everything in Python is an object][everythings an object].


Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
The [Python Software Foundation][psf] manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development and receives proposals for changes to the language from [members][psf membership] of the community via [Python Enhancement Proposals or PEPs][peps].
It is considered a strong language for programmers [starting their journey][python for beginners], with a welcoming community and many resources available to learners of all levels and persuasions.


Python puts a strong emphasis on code readability and (_similar to Haskell_) uses [significant indentation][significant indentation] to denote function, method, and class definitions.
Code can be written and executed from the command line, in an interactive interpreter session, in [JupyterLab][jupyter] (Jupyter notebook), or a wide variety of [code editors and IDEs][editors for python].

[Python is used extensively][python is used extensively] in scientific computing, finance, games, networking, internet development, and in assembling pipelines of other programs.


The [zen of Python (PEP 20)][the zen of python] and [What is Pythonic?][what is pythonic] lay out additional philosophies and perspectives on the language.


This track currently uses `Python 3.9.0`.
It is highly recommended that students upgrade to at least `Python 3.8`, as some features used by this track may not be supported in earlier versions.
That being said, most exercises can be completed using Python 3.7, and many can be worked in Python 3.6.
We will note when a feature is only available in a certain version.


Complete documentation for the current release of Python (3.9.7) can be found at [docs.python.org][python docs].
